1. Given and list of options and a list of relative probability
create a function that outputs those options with those relative probabilities

so like say cat, dog, mouse
and  2, 3,4
you want cat 2/9 times
dog 3/9 times
mouse 4/9 times


2. Given a list of strings, find a pair that uses the same distinct characters


so like abc and cbbaa use the same distinct characters
because you ignore order and frequency


3. Given a m x n array, find the number of paths that you can take from
the bottom left to the bottom right corner where at every spot, you can
move right, right-up or right-down
