Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.


Idea:

I have a binary tree.
Use Recursion


1. Try solving a smaller problem - > go to the leaf of the tree and invert the children
