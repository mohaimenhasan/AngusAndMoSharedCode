Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.



Mohaimen's Thought Process:

// So the whole idea is I need a method to make sure I have atleast k repeating chars in the substring
// Definitely need a hash function
// My minimum run time will be O(n)
